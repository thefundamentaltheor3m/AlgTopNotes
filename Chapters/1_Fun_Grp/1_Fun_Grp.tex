Our broad objective will be to \textit{associate invariants to spaces}. Let's begin by putting together a `wishlist' of things we would want such `invariants' to obey.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We want our invariants to be \textit{invariant under deformations}: if we `do something' to a space (`deform' it), we don't want that to affect our invariant.

    \item We want our invariants to be \textit{functorial}: an invariant describing spaces should describe groups if we move from spaces to group in a nice way.

    \item We want our invariants to \textit{completely classify spaces} (possibly up to deformation): in other words, we want a `converse' to invariance under deformations, where we know that if our invariant is unchanged by some transformation, then that transformation must be a compatible one (a `deformation').

    \item We would (ideally) want our definition to be \textit{easily computable}.
\end{itemize}

Now that we have a list of things we'd like to do, why don't we go ahead and... do them?!
